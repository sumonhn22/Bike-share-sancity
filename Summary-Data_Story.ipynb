    "## 1. Problem statement\n",
    "\n",
    "**This analysis assumes the following hypothetical scenario**: \n",
    "\n",
    "\"California accounts for 14.5% of the nation’s bicycle riders. A total of 645 person were the causality of accident in San Francisco County in 2014\". Bicyclists above 20 years old represented the large majority of the victims and, 74% of them being male [1] .To make things worse, there has been a sharp increase of bike accidents with increased fatalities in the Bay area that involves the car, motorcycle, bicycle and pedestrian [2]. The government of the City and County of San Francisco Bay area wants to launch a three months long bike safety campaign with a promotional slogan-\"Safer Biking Together”. The objective of the campaign is to raise awareness among the bikers to abide by the safety aspects of the roads to reduce potential accidents. As a part of the campaign electronic advertisements boards will be used across the city for a part of the day. In order to successfully run the campaign, a right strategy needs to be set to run a targeted campaign that can be reached to the largest number of people. \n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis will explore various aspects of the bike sharing data and some recommendations will be made that will be the basis for the campaign.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Dataset Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. What is the structure of this dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "The data consists of the biking information of 1.65 million instances from Nov 2017-Sep 2018. From the starting time, different aspects of time like- hour, duration, whether the day is weekend or not has been extracted. Also from the longitude and latitude, the distance of the journey has been calculated. At this point, There are 26 features in the dataset out of which 8 are string values as can be seen from the summary information. \n",
    "\n",
    "The qualitative variables provide information about the start station name, end station_name, gender of the rider, and user type- Customer or a Subscriber, longitude and latitude of the starting and ending station and the month when the journey started. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. What is/are the main feature(s) of interest in the dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm most interested in figuring out the main characteristics of the bikers, and the variation between the user types, age and gender groups across various time of the year.  I will investigate the dataset for their riding patterns in terms of distance and duration covered during the journey to find out the important features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. What features in the dataset do you think will help support your investigation into your feature(s) of interest?\n",
    "\n",
    "Age, distance, duration, starting and ending stations are be the most interesting features of the dataset for me. \n",
    "\n",
    "To perform the analysis, I will divide the age, distance and duration data into different categories related to gender-Male, Female or other type, age group, and user type-customers or subscribers. Finally, I will find the busiest routes of biking from the starting and ending stations. Based on the analysis, I will make specific recommendations that will be used during the targeted campaign.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of exploring all the univeraiate, Bivariate and Multivariate variables all at once, I will analyze the univariate variables like user type, age, gender, duration, starting and ending stations in each section of the analysis. Time to time, I will show the relationship between the vriables such as- the age of the gender group, age of the users, distance and duration per user group in various days etc. to explore the bivariate and multivariate relations. This in my opinion makes the story more co-herent and interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Findings of the Exploratory Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The findings of the exploratory analysis is summarized below:\n",
    "A.\t88.61% of the bikers are Subscribers and 11.39% are the subscribers\n",
    "\n",
    "B.\tAmong the bikers 73.5% are male and 24.92 % are female. Female percentage is higher among the Customers than the subscribers.\n",
    "\n",
    "C.\t80% of the bikers are less than 43 years old and 99% of the bikers are in the range of 18-66 years old. Larger number of young male bikers explains why the accident victims are mostly young male.\n",
    "\n",
    "D.\tIn working days (Mon-Friday),  8 and 17 hours are the two peak hours and in the weekend 13hr is the peak hour of the day.\n",
    "\n",
    "E.\tTuesday and Wednesday are the busiest days of the week and Saturday and Sunday are the quietest days of the week with the least number of bikers on the road.\n",
    "\n",
    "F.\tMay to October is the busiest time of the year. More than 60% of the total journeys take place during this time of the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "G.\tBoth the Subscribers and the customers prefer May to September for biking and they follow almost similar pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "H.\tSummer comprises of the month June to August and it is the busiest season of the year. December to February is the season of winter and the least amount of biking take place during this time of the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "I.\tOn average, Customers bike for a much longer duration than the Subscribers. Both the customers and the subscribers bike for a longer duration in the weekend.\n",
    "\n",
    "J.\tCustomers and Subscribers bike for the longest duration during summer weekends and the lowest during winter weekdays.\n",
    "\n",
    "K.\tMost of the customers and subscribers bike 0-3 kilometers distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "L.\tOn average, bikers bike almost similar distance throughout the week in all the months.\n",
    "\n",
    "M.\tThere is no significant correlation between age, distance and duration of biking.\n",
    "\n",
    "N.\tBusiest starting and ending stations and the most popular starting and ending stations has been listed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Explanatory Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In the explanatory analysis, I have mostly used line charts to show trend over time, bar chart and stacked bar chart to show categorical variables like distance, duration and age category. To show the distribution of age boxplot have been used. However, I have made a deliberate choice not to use any fancy plot as in the real life it is easy to convey a story among the viewers when they can read a graph easily. I have added comments, text, annotations and color hues to emphasize and creating pre-attentive attributes for the viewers. Finally, at the end of the explanatory visuals, I have made 05 specific recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the project, I have taken feedback from some of my friends. I have got following feedback :\n",
    "\n",
    "• Initially, I just started exploring the dataset. One of my friends has suggested adding a problem statement at the beginning of the analysis to make it an interesting story. After receiving the feedback, I have added a problem statement at the beginning of the story.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tI was tempted to use most of the visualization. One of the viewers has suggested me to reduce the number of visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tI have asked two other colleagues for their feedback to understand what features of this dataset might be interesting for them. One of them has suggested the impact of season. I have extracted the season from the dataset to see the busiest season for the bikers.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tAt times, I was tempted to use more fancy plots. But from the feedback, I realized it is not a good idea to use uncommon plots that takes time for the readers to understand. Instead, I should use plots that the readers can understand easily. So, I used the most common graphs to leverage the user experience. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. LEARNINGS\n",
    "\n",
    "I have learnt the following important lessons-\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tThe power of storytelling to convey an important message in a presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tHow to analyze a data set with a structure that is readily accessible by the viewer, and why we should always keep the viewer's perspectives in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tWhy some plots and graphs are better than others, and what are the attributes of good plots. \n",
    "\n",
    "•\tHow to think like a designer and make plots accessible to a reader.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tFinally, it is important to get some fresh perspectives, as our data analysis is as good as it is perceived by the audience.\n",
