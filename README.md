# Data Analyst Nano Degree-Project 5


## 1. Background & Objective of the Project

The objective of this project is to use Python’s data visualization tools to systematically explore a selected dataset for its properties and relationships between variables. The project assumes a scenario and answers some questions to tell a story using data. 

This analysis assumes the following hypothetical scenario :

"California accounts for 14.5% of the nation’s bicycle riders. A total of 645 people were the casualty of the accidents in San Francisco County in 2014". Bicyclists above 20 years old represented the large majority of the victims, and, 74% of them being male [1]. In the recent years, there has been a sharp increase in bike accidents with increased fatalities in the Bay area that involves the car, motorcycle, bicycle and pedestrians[2]. The government of the City and County of San Francisco Bay area wants to launch a bike safety campaign, with the promotional slogan-"Safer Biking Together”. The objective of the campaign is to raise awareness among the bikers, to abide by the safety aspects of the roads to reduce accidents. As part of the campaign, electronic advertisements boards will be used across the city for a part of the day. In order to successfully run a targeted campaign, the right strategy needs to be set so that the largest number of people can be reached.

This analysis will explore various aspects of the bike sharing data and some recommendations will be made that will be the basis for the campaign.



## 2. Installations

This project was written in Python, using Jupyter Notebook on Anaconda. The relevant Python packages for this project are as follows:

* pandas 

* matplotlib

* seaborn 

* numpy

* matplotlib.pyplot as plt


To follow the steps it is recommended to install Anaconda, a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project.
